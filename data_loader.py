    dataset: The Dataset object to pick data from
    config: The model config object
    shuffle: If True, shuffles the samples before every epoch
    augment: (deprecated. Use augmentation instead). If true, apply random
        image augmentation. Currently, only horizontal flipping is offered.
    augmentation: Optional. An imgaug (https://github.com/aleju/imgaug) augmentation.
        For example, passing imgaug.augmenters.Fliplr(0.5) flips images
        right/left 50% of the time.
    random_rois: If > 0 then generate proposals to be used to train the
                 network classifier and mask heads. Useful if training
                 the Mask RCNN part without the RPN.
    batch_size: How many images to return in each call
    detection_targets: If True, generate detection targets (class IDs, bbox
        deltas, and masks). Typically for debugging or visualizations because
        in trainig detection targets are generated by DetectionTargetLayer.
    no_augmentation_sources: Optional. List of sources to exclude for
        augmentation. A source is string that identifies a dataset and is
        defined in the Dataset class.
    Returns a Python generator. Upon calling next() on it, the
    generator returns two lists, inputs and outputs. The contents

    - rpn_bbox: [batch, N, (dy, dx, log(dh), log(dw))] Anchor bbox deltas.
    - gt_class_ids: [batch, MAX_GT_INSTANCES] Integer class IDs
    - gt_boxes: [batch, MAX_GT_INSTANCES, (y1, x1, y2, x2)]
    - gt_masks: [batch, height, width, MAX_GT_INSTANCES]. The height and width
                are those of the image unless use_mini_mask is True, in which
                case they are defined in MINI_MASK_SHAPE.
    outputs list: Usually empty in regular training. But if detection_targets
        is True then the outputs list contains target class_ids, bbox deltas,
